	 *         literal on the right hand side makes it possible to guarantee uniqueness since no two hosts should be using the same domain
	 *         name or IP address at the same time. Though other algorithms will work, it is recommended that the right hand side contain
	 *         some domain identifier (either of the host itself or otherwise) such that the generator of the message identifier can
